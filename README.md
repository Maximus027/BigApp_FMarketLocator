#NYC BigApp2017Android Application Project

####Farmer's Market Locator

This is a project submission to the NYC BigApps 2017 competition for helping those in the NYC area have access to local farmer's markets to promote healthy eating.

Currently this app pulls data for Farmer's market locations from one of NYC OpenData's APIs.

The tool used to pull JSON is Retrofit.

The app uses Google Maps API to display the address of the market after a particular one has been chosen.
